## Game Overview

- This game will help computer science students learn about key tree algorithms like Binary Search, Merge Sort, Tree Balancing, and Depth-First Search (DFS) 
- It will have challenges based on these concepts, with a leaderboard and timer to make it more engaging
- We will implement the game logic in C and provide an object-oriented interface using C++ for better user interaction

## Basic Structure of the Game
- C: For low-level implementations such as tree manipulation, sorting, and basic file operations
- C++: For the game interface, object-oriented design, user interaction, and game logic (timer, scoring, levels, and leaderboard)
  
## Game Features

- Challenges: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Tree Balancing (Rotations), and DFS traversal.
- Levels: Increase difficulty by adding more nodes and requiring more complex operations.
- Leaderboard: Track performance using a file system (text file) to store scores.
- Timer: Measure the time taken to solve each challenge to make the game more exciting.
